I have learned and covered many concepts in JavaScript. I have gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, improving my problem-solving skills.

### JavaScript Learning Journey :-
I have learned and covered many concepts in JavaScript.
Below are the key topics I explored :

## 📌 JavaScript Concepts Covered
###  Variables & Data Types  
- Learned about `var`, `let`, and `const`

- Understood **callbacks, promises, and async/await** for handling API requests  

### APIs  
- Learned how to fetch data using `fetch()` and handle JSON responses  

I have built multiple projects using these concepts, improving my problem-solving skills. Now, I am comfortable working with JavaScript and building interactive web applications. 🚀
