# JavaScript-Programs
I have learned and covered many concepts in JavaScript. I have gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, improving my problem-solving skills.


## JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€
I have learned and covered many concepts in **JavaScript**. 
Below are the key topics I explored :-

# ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Concepts Covered
## âœ… Variables & Data Types  
- Learned about `var`, `let`, and `const`
